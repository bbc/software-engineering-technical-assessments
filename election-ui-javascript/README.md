# Mock Election UI

If you are not familiar with how elections work in the UK, please see this short BBC video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxUhGetEPQ

This repository contains a fake 'in progress' elections UI.

Before your election we would like you to get a 'local' environment set up to run this application.

Setup
---

Requires: Node (14)

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Notes:
1) You will see some console warnings when running the 'build' and 'start' step. Assuming the application starts up correctly these can be ignored.
2) The contents of the fakeAPI directory can be ignored. They exist to mock an external API for the purpose of the assessment.

At this point we don't ask you to do any more until your booked assessment time.

Assessment Time
---

In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment and talk through the following with us:

1) What does this system do? What are its key features?
2) New Feature requests! - The election product team have some feature requests that we would like you to take a look at. They can be found in `tasks.md`.

If you have any problems with any of this, please get in touch via your recruitment contact.

Thanks :)
