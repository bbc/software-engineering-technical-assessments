Software Engineering Technical Assessments
---

Hello!

This repository contains a few pieces of software. One of which will be used as the basis for your interview technical assessment when applying to join a BBC team.

The applications:

- `election-api-golang` A fake election API written with Go
- `election-api-java` A fake election API written with Java
- `election-api-javascript` A fake election API written with NodeJS
- `election-api-scala` A fake election API written with Scala
- `election-api-python` A fake elction API written with Python
- `election-ui-javascript` A fake elections Web UI written with React and Javascript

Each makes up part a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how BBC News covers elections, for example: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c37d28xdn99t/scottish-parliament-election-2021. These pieces of software don't rely on one another or interact in any way.

Your assessment will be based around ONE of these applications, so please select the ONE with which you are most comfortable and that gives you the best opportunity to show your ability. More information on each can be found inside the readme of the relevant application. Once you have decided, please let your recruitment contact know.

Before the assessment interview itself you don't need to do any work on any of the applications, however we would like you to familiarise yourself with your chosen assessment, and follow its "setup" step. In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment with us (we use Zoom) as we discuss and work on the following:

1) How does the software work?
2) Are there any changes/improvements that you would suggest and/or want to tackle?
3) Our elections product team have asked for some new features to be added! With the help of a pair, you will be asked to try to implement one or more of these features.
