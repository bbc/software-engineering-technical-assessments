## Description
The results API presents a simple elections result service.

### Domain
The domain for the election represents some key concepts:
- _**consituencyId**_ a unique integer id to identify a location. E.g "Brent Central" is 90
- _**party**_ is a short 3, or 4, letter code for a party for instance LAB = Labour, CON = Conservative etc.
- _**votes**_ the number of votes gained by a party in a constituency
- _**share**_ the % share of the total votes the party received

### API
The API has 3 endpoints:
- GET `/result/{id}` to get an elections result for a given id.
- POST `/result` to add a new result
- GET `/scoreboard` to get the running totals. This is unimplemented.
